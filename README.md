My vision for project # 2 was to have a functioning CRUD app which uses javascript, express, mongodb, mongoose & ejs to document tape collections and where users could add to the collection and edit.

Using the 7 RESTful routes users can access the cassette database & interact with it as well as share and collaborate.
